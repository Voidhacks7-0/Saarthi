RESPONSIVE DESIGN:
==================

Mobile (< 768px):
  - Sidebar collapses into hamburger menu
  - All sections stack vertically (1 column)
  - Quick actions: 1 column grid
  - Stats: 1-2 columns
  - Buttons take full width
  - Welcome banner hidden (space saving)
  - Optimized padding and spacing

Tablet (768px - 1024px):
  - Sidebar visible as sidebar
  - Main content in 2-column layout where applicable
  - Quick actions: 2-3 columns
  - Stats: 2 columns
  - Reduced font sizes for fit

Desktop (> 1024px):
  - Full 3-column layout (left + right sidebar)

3. Admin Approves → Status changed to "approved"
4. Faculty Signs In → Data loaded from localStorage
5. Role Check → Redirected to /dashboard/faculty
